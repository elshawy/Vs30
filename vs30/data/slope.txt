Slope for input to Hybrid Geology Model

1. Download SRTM
originally used contour line based DEM, use SRTM because suitable for terrain analysis
3s because downsampling to ~9s anyway and has water cut out, no voids on land.
earthexplorer.usgs.gov.

2. Combine Tiles
gdal_merge.py -v -o srtm3s.tif -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -n -32768 -a_nodata -32768 srtm_*.tif

3. Downsample, Convert to EPSG:2193
original code used 270m EPSG:27200 resolution (bilinear resampling)
keeping 270m for consistency with other research but using EPSG:2193 for all datasets
gdalwarp -t_srs epsg:2193 -te 1060040 4730000 2120060 6250100 -tr 270 270 -r bilinear -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE srtm3s.tif srtm270.tif

4. calculate slope
the -s 100 here is to make output units as 0.01 per percentage instead of 1/percentage
compute edges makes sure there are values on the coast instead of nan. wasn't used originally, not needed because nans treated as 0 in code
gdaldem slope srtm270.tif slope.tif -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -s 100 -p -alg Horn
