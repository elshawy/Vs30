Slope for input to Geology Model

1. download slope tiffs (used NZGD2000 EPSG:2193)
https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/131-nzdem-north-island-25-metre/
https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/127-nzdem-south-island-25-metre/

2. clean
found some broken rasters in south island when opened in qgis
remove broken ones, tiles still had full coverage

3. combine
nodata value is taken from one of the tiles using gdalinfo
gdal_merge.py -o nzdem.tif -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -ot Float32 -n -3.4028234663852886e+38 -a_nodata -3.4028234663852886e+38 ni/*.tif si/*.tif

4. calculate slope
gdaldem slope nzdem.tif nzslope.tif -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -s 1 -p -compute_edges -alg Horn

5. downsampling
