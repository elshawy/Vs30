Slope for input to Hybrid Geology Model

1. download slope tiffs (used NZGD2000/NZTM EPSG:2193)
https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/131-nzdem-north-island-25-metre/
https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/layer/127-nzdem-south-island-25-metre/

2. clean
found some broken rasters in south island when opened in qgis
most likely issues converting from original NZGD49 EPSG:27200
remove broken ones, tiles still had full coverage

3. combine
nodata value is taken from one of the tiles using gdalinfo
gdal_merge.py -o nzdem.tif -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -ot Float32 -n -3.4028234663852886e+38 -a_nodata -3.4028234663852886e+38 ni/*.tif si/*.tif

4. downsample (optional)
original code used 270m EPSG:27200 resolution (billinear resampling)

5. calculate slope
the -s 100 here is to make output units as 0.01 per percentage instead of 1/percentage
compute edges makes sure there are values on the coast instead of nan. wasn't used originally
gdaldem slope nzdem.tif slope.tif -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -s 100 -p -compute_edges -alg Horn
